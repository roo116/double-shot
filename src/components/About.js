      <h2>Double Shot</h2>
      <p>
      Durhamâ€™s own Double Shot Band - known for playing all the favorite classic rock covers from the Allman Brothers to ZZ Top. We play hits from the 70's, 80's and 90's. Scott Sublett pounds the drums and belts out the vocals. Mark Allman and Chip Hill play those favorite guitar licks you love to hear. And last but not least, Tim Blinsmon on the bass covers those bottom grooves. Put it all together and the experience is one that is not to be missed!! Scott hails from the great state of Georgia, but he has called Durham home for many years. Chip lives in Carrboro and Mark and Tim are good ol' local boys born and raised in Durham.
